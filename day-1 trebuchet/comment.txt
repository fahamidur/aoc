There are two parts of this problem

part-1:
input {
For example:
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.
}

read the string line by line
read only the numbers sequencially. 
take the first and last number and add then side by side to make 2 digit.
add all those number from every line
answer would be  56108.

part 2:
input {
    two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.
}

in some cases the numbers are spelt out. in that case take a map consists of spelt out number as key and numbers as values.
match if the key exists in the string and replce it.

*****Special Edge case***
in some cases the numbers are spelt as oneight, this should come as 18. so sovle this issue. only replace the middle charecter
of the matched string with the map vlaue. for example o1ei8ht.

the answer of the second part should be  55652
